# Traffic_Sign_Classification_Model_CNN
**Iâ€™m happy to share the completion of Task 4 in my Machine Learning internship at Elevvo Pathways, where I built a Traffic Sign Recognition System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)! ðŸš¦ðŸ“Š
ðŸ”¹ Key Tasks Accomplished:
âœ… Dataset: Leveraged the GTSRB dataset (Kaggle) for multi-class traffic sign classification.
âœ… Preprocessing: Applied resizing, normalization, and augmentation (rotations, shifts, flips) to enhance model generalization.
âœ… Custom CNN Model: Designed and trained a lightweight CNN from scratch, achieving high accuracy (~98%) while maintaining low memory footprint.
âœ… Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning: Implemented MobileNet (pre-trained on ImageNet) and fine-tuned it using hyperparameter optimization (learning rate, batch size, epochs) via Scikit-learn 
âœ… Performance Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, and confusion matrices.
ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries:
Python | TensorFlow | Keras | OpenCV | Scikit-learn 
ðŸ”¹ Key Insights:
 MobileNet showed strong performance but required 4x more memory than my custom CNN.
Hyperparameter tuning (via Scikit-learn) improved MobileNetâ€™s accuracy by ~3%, though my manual CNN remained more efficient for edge deployment.
This project deepened my expertise in CNN architectures, transfer learning, and model optimizationâ€”proving that tailored solutions can outperform heavyweight pre-trained models in resource-constrained scenarios! ðŸŽ¯**
